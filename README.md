# AES 128 Encryption in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the AES 128 encryption algorithm. The program accepts a 128-bit hexadecimal string as input, encrypts it using AES 128, and returns the encrypted output.
   
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
An IDE (like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)
   
## Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
- Navigate to the cloned repository.
- Open the Python file in your preferred IDE.
   
## Usage
The main function of the program accepts a 128-bit hexadecimal string as input. It encrypts this input using the AES 128 encryption algorithm and returns the encrypted output.
   
## Running the Tests
A unit test file is included in the same workspace. To run the tests:
- Open the test file in your IDE.
- Run the test file.
